# Case Studies: Business Upsides of Cloud Deployment

This document outlines key case studies demonstrating the specific upsides of cloud deployments, categorized by primary business drivers: **Speed/Innovation**, **Efficiency/Cost**, and **Scale/Resilience**.

---

## 1. Speed to Market & Innovation
**The Upside:** The cloud removes the "waiting for hardware" bottleneck, allowing R&D teams to test complex ideas and launch products in days rather than months.

### Case Study: Moderna (Healthcare)
* **Provider:** AWS
* **The Challenge:** Developing a COVID-19 vaccine required analyzing massive amounts of genomic data and running complex algorithms—a process that traditionally takes years.
* **Cloud Upside:** Moderna used cloud-based high-performance computing to run disparate algorithms in parallel.
* **Key Result:** They designed and finalized the sequence for their mRNA vaccine in just **2 days**.

### Case Study: Blue Origin (Aerospace)
* **Provider:** AWS
* **The Challenge:** Designing hardware for lunar landers involves complex engineering simulations that are computationally expensive and slow to iterate on.
* **Cloud Upside:** By moving design simulations to the cloud, they ran thousands of design variations simultaneously.
* **Key Result:** Compressed the design cycle from **years to days**, allowing engineers to print and test prototypes immediately.

## 2. Operational Efficiency & Cost Reduction
**The Upside:** Moving to the cloud shifts spending from "keeping the lights on" (maintenance) to "building value" (software), often lowering Total Cost of Ownership (TCO).

### Case Study: Capital One (Finance)
* **Provider:** AWS
* **The Challenge:** The bank was slowed down by maintaining eight massive on-premise data centers. Updates to banking software took months to provision.
* **Cloud Upside:** Executed a total migration, closing all 8 data centers.
* **Key Results:**
    * Reduced development environment setup time from **3 months to minutes**.
    * Eliminated physical facility management overhead, reinvesting funds into software talent.

### Case Study: Mazda (Automotive)
* **Provider:** Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)
* **The Challenge:** On-premise graphics-intensive 3D design systems were expensive to maintain and difficult to upgrade.
* **Cloud Upside:** Migrated high-performance computing workloads to the cloud.
* **Key Results:**
    * Realized a **70% performance increase**.
    * Estimated **50% lower Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)** over five years.

## 3. Scale & Resilience
**The Upside:** The cloud allows businesses to handle massive, unexpected spikes in traffic without crashing and without paying for idle servers during quiet times.

### Case Study: Netflix (Media & Entertainment)
* **Provider:** AWS
* **The Challenge:** A major database corruption in 2008 halted DVD shipments for three days. Physical data centers couldn't scale fast enough for their pivot to streaming.
* **Cloud Upside:** Re-architected the entire platform on the cloud to support global scaling.
* **Key Results:**
    * Now supports **260+ million members** across 190 countries.
    * **Chaos Engineering:** Utilizes "Chaos Monkey" to randomly shut down servers, ensuring automated recovery without user interruption.

### Case Study: MakeMyTrip (Travel)
* **Provider:** AWS
* **The Challenge:** Faced massive traffic fluctuations—huge spikes during holidays and lulls during off-seasons. Buying servers for "peak" capacity wasted money 90% of the year.
* **Cloud Upside:** Utilized "Auto Scaling" to automatically add/remove servers based on real-time traffic.
* **Key Result:** Achieved a **22% reduction in compute costs** while maintaining 99.9% availability during peak seasons.
