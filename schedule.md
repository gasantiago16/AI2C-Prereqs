# AI2C Tech Intro

## ALL LESSONS
- Take a look at all lessons and add funny engaging videos throughout (The Office, SNL)

## Lesson 1

### Intro to Python

- In a good place now
- Be a little more guided about environment setup

## Lesson 2

### Intro to Networking

- Not in a good place, needs a lot of love
- Should we even teach this anymore?

## Lesson 3

### Intro to Linux

- Need to review some of the in class exercises to validate the commands are correct
- Needs more WSL setup instruction / troubleshooting guide
- Maybe add some content about reading error messages??

### Intro to Version Control

- Good intro
- Probably needs more visuals or other learning modalities such as videos

## Lesson 4

### Conditional Statements and Errors

- Rework slide material to be less verbose and more instructive
- Separate out exception handling??

## Lesson 5

### IPv4

- Needs a lot of love and a better instructor
- Should we even teach this anymore?

### Git Branching

- Could possibly merge with another git lesson?
- Also needs other learning modalities to really sink in

## Lesson 6

### File IO

- Could use a Linux primer/review beforehand
- 

### Data Structures

- Wasn't conducted

## Lesson 7

- Restyle to AI2C format
- Probably discuss a little more history of the cloud

## Lesson 8
- A great and thorough introduction to OOP
- The feedback for the exercise was mixed.  It is complex, but should be retained.  Consider adding one or two simpler exercises before
beginning to build the game.

## Lesson 9
- Add in a prep exercise to review Linux commands.  This will prepare people for Lesson 10.
- This material is good, but needs some work.  Add a few simple practical exercises before the current practicals.

## Lesson 10
- Some of the material here is redundant from Cloud Basics.  The practical is really good, but some of the concepts need to be explained before.  SSH, nano vs. vim, other networking concepts that should be covered earlier?

## Lesson 11
- There's some good graphics in here, but consider adding some videos or visuals to the git lesson? 

## Lesson 12
- Great feedback from this.  Retain.  This was a comprehensive review.

## Lesson 13
- Good class, should be conducted on cArmy, if possible

## Lesson 14
- Good intro but could use some better exercises on usage.

## Lesson 15
- Possibly do one last practical exercise here covering the last half of the course?
